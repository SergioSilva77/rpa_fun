# Git & Collaboration

- Make changes reviewable: small commits, focused diffs.
- Use clear commit messages (imperative mood), e.g.:
  - `Fix hit-testing tolerance in polyline selection`
  - `Refactor: extract CoordinateTransformService`
- Avoid drive-by formatting changes.
- When changing public APIs, update docs and call sites in the same change.
