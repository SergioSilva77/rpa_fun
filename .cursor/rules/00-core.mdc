# Core rules

## Working style
- Prefer **small, safe changes** over rewrites.
- If you are not sure, ask **1–3 specific questions** (not a long questionnaire).
- When you propose changes, include:
  - what you changed
  - why
  - any trade-offs
  - how to test (commands or steps)

## Truthfulness / safety
- Do not invent APIs, framework capabilities, filenames, or existing project structure.
- If something must be verified (version, API behavior, build step), say so and propose a concrete verification.

## Output format
- For code changes, prefer:
  - the exact file path(s)
  - a patch-style diff, or full file content if requested
- Keep responses technical and direct.
